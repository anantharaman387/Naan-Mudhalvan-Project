The House Rent App, built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, and Node.js), provides an intuitive platform for users to browse, list, and manage rental properties. Landlords can post listings, while tenants can search, filter, and contact property owners. With features like user authentication, real-time updates, and seamless communication, the app aims to simplify the rental process for both tenants and landlords, offering a smooth and efficient experience.
